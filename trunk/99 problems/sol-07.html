<h1>Flatten a nested list structure: solution</h1>
<p>To flatten a list, we need to make use of either
<code title="py_code">append</code> to add an element to a new list, or
<code title="py_code">extend</code> to "add" a list to another one.  When
we "add" a list, we need to make sure that it is a "flat list" - so we
call flatten on it.
</p>
<p>Run the following doctest to verify that the solution given works as
expected.</p>
<pre title="doctest linenumber">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def flatten(some_list):
...     flat_list = []
...     for item in some_list:
...         if isinstance(item, list):
...             flat_list.extend(flatten(item))
...         else:
...            flat_list.append(item)
...     return flat_list
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [0, 1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; flatten(a_list)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; another_list = [['a', ['b', ['c']]], 'd', [['e']], 'f']
&gt;&gt;&gt; flatten(another_list)
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
</pre>
<p>We could <code title="py_code">flatten</code> more generic by allowing it
to flatten other types of sequences, such as tuples.  One way to do this
would be to replace the test on line 4 by the following</p>
<pre title="py_code linenumber=4">
...         if isinstance(item, (list, tuple)):
</pre>
<p>To extend this method, we need to add explicitly new types of sequences
allowed.  An alternative is to check for behavior: a sequence S is an iterable
type, which means that <code title="py_code">hasattr(S, "__iter__")</code> would
return <code title="py_code">True</code>.
The caveat with using this approach is that other non-sequence
objects (such as strings or dicts) also share this attribute and we would need
to exclude them explicitly.
